# Welcome to my technical diary ü§Ø

Here you will find all of my curated study notes on various tech topics including Python, Data Science, AI/ML including Generative AI ( and in future some real world use cases on AI/IoT etc) and many more.

## Good news is üòç

All the notes present here are executable jupyter notebooks **(you can directly execute them on Colab by clicking on üöÄ icon )** which can immediately get you started on any tech topic.

## Target Audience üßê
This course is designed for beginners who **DO NOT WANT** to waste time on watching many hours long course videos but want to learn but actually doing it..

**GO THROUGH THIS FREE COURSE** :
- If you want to learn by implementing it first üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨
- If you want to learn and remember for long ‚è∞
- If you want to learn in the fastest way possible ‚è∞

## Course Structure
This course starts with setting up the essentials ready which would help drive you towards the end goal easily

### Essentials
Before starting your journey, you need to know some bare minimum essentials required to understand further. These bare minimum essentials include:
- Python 
- Mathematics
- Statistics

### Toolbox
Once you have got the essentials tight, now is the time to fill up your toolbox with different tools that will make your life easy by providing optimized methods to perform all the required operations.

- Statistical and visualization libraries
- Data Anlaytics libraries
- Machine learning tools

### Concepts
Now you know the basic concepts and toolbox, It's the time to reveal the big secret of AI / ML. Conceptual understanding of how things work. This section would contain the core logic AI/ML, i.e. Gradient Descent, we will discuss various algorithms of Supervised and Unsupervised learning and would also touch upon the Neural Networks. 

We will also discuss various data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization techniques along with the various ML model experimentations, like ensembling , hyperparamater tuning etc.

### Core engineering
Its the time to connect all the dots and work end to end to solve a problem of classical ML. We will be learning how to create a workable application. 

### Real world use cases
This section would contain all the real world excerices and curated executable examples with different scenarios.
