    "\n",
    "With Python you can do pretty much do anything, you can automate every task. Its simpler to learn and use than any other language without much jargons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs â€” or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.\n"
